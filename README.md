## Lab Question Answers

Answer for Question 1: 

Firstly, according to https://www.easypost.com/guides/api-scalability, API scalability means that the servers can handle many requests at the same time without issue. Some things that can benefit scalability include being stateless, which means that the server does not have to know any previous information to handle the next one. According to https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11297471/why-are-restful-applications-easier-to-scale, this is pertinent to the REST Api's because the S in REST means that it is stateless. This is (also according to the website) because of the HTTP protocol which it is built upon being stateless.

Answer for Question 3:

According to the source https://restfulapi.net/rest-put-vs-post/, PUT is used to update a certain resource. This means that in our mail server, we could use this method to perhaps update a mail by perhaps changing a certain piece of mail to mark it as important, for example, or perhaps add on to a certain piece of mail to showcase a mail message stream (one mail sent after another mail to the same sender under the same subject).
